"""
Provides a functional interface for transforms
(usually working on single tensors rather then collections thereof).
All transformations are implemented to work on batched tensors.
Implementations include:

* Affine Transforms
* Channel Transforms
* Cropping Transforms
* Device Transforms
* Intensity Transforms
* Spatial Transforms
* Tensor Transforms
* Utility Transforms
