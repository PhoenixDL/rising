        Linear 1D interpolation on the GPU for Pytorch.
        This function returns interpolated values of a set of 1-D functions at
        the desired query points `xnew`.
        This function is working similarly to Matlabâ„¢ or scipy functions with
        the `linear` interpolation mode on, except that it parallelises over
        any number of desired interpolation problems.
        The code will run on GPU if all the tensors provided are on a cuda
        device.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x : (N, ) or (D, N) Pytorch Tensor
            A 1-D or 2-D tensor of real values.
        y : (N,) or (D, N) Pytorch Tensor
            A 1-D or 2-D tensor of real values. The length of `y` along its
            last dimension must be the same as that of `x`
        xnew : (P,) or (D, P) Pytorch Tensor
            A 1-D or 2-D tensor of real values. `xnew` can only be 1-D if
            _both_ `x` and `y` are 1-D. Otherwise, its length along the first
            dimension must be the same as that of whichever `x` and `y` is 2-D.
        out : Pytorch Tensor, same shape as `xnew`
            Tensor for the output. If None: allocated automatically.
